This is my first "big" project in html, afterwards I'll add a 
description of how it went.

After finishing the project I've learned a lot, specially how repetitive 
things can get after a while and how important it is to learn shortcuts 
to make better use of the time. Also I used this project to make a series 
of commits using the guidelines provided in class, I think I'm getting a 
better understanding of how to use commits effectively. Now I can only hope 
to remember how to do the push!
